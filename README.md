# Feature Flag Service Design Document

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the design and architecture for a Feature Flag Service, a system that enables developers to toggle features on or off remotely without requiring code deployments. This service will provide a reliable and scalable platform for feature management, progressive rollouts, A/B testing, and user targeting.

### 1.2 Scope
This design document covers the backend components of the Feature Flag Service, including:
- REST API for feature flag management
- SDK for client applications to consume feature flags
- Administration and configuration interfaces (API only)
- Data storage and retrieval mechanisms
- Performance, scalability, and security considerations

Frontend UI components are out of scope for the initial implementation and will be addressed in future iterations.

### 1.3 System Overview
The Feature Flag Service is a backend system that allows applications to check the state of feature flags at runtime. Key capabilities include:
- Creating, updating, and deleting feature flags
- Defining targeting rules based on user attributes
- Percentage-based rollouts
- A/B testing with multiple variations
- Real-time updates to flag states
- SDKs for easy integration with client applications

The service will provide a REST API for management operations and a high-performance evaluation API for client applications to check flag states with minimal latency.

## 2. Architecture
### 2.1 High-Level Architecture

The Feature Flag Service will follow a microservices architecture with the following components:

1. **API Gateway**: Entry point for all client requests, handles authentication, request routing, and rate limiting.

2. **Management Service**: Handles CRUD operations for feature flags, environments, and targeting rules.

3. **Evaluation Service**: High-performance service for evaluating feature flags based on user context.

4. **Analytics Service**: Collects and processes flag evaluation events for reporting and insights.

5. **SDK Service**: Provides client SDKs with the ability to fetch flag configurations and stream updates.

6. **Data Store**: Supabase PostgreSQL database for storing flag configurations and user segments.

7. **Cache Layer**: Redis for caching flag configurations and evaluation results to minimize latency.

## 3. API Design

## 5. Performance Considerations
### 5.1 Caching Strategy

Performance is critical for a feature flag service, as flag evaluations are often in the critical path of application requests. The service will implement a multi-level caching strategy to minimize latency.

#### Flag Configuration Caching

1. **Server-Side Cache**:
   - **Cache Layer**: Redis as the primary cache store.
   - **Cache Structure**: Hash maps by environment ID for efficient bulk retrieval.
   - **Cached Data**: Complete flag configurations including targeting rules.
   - **Invalidation Strategy**: Immediate invalidation on flag updates with version tracking.
   - **TTL**: Configurable with default of 5 minutes to prevent stale data.

2. **SDK-Side Cache**:
   - **Local Memory Cache**: In-memory cache within SDK instances.
   - **Cache Structure**: Optimized for evaluation performance.
   - **Cached Data**: Flag configurations, pre-processed for fast evaluation.
   - **Background Polling**: Periodic refresh (default: 1 minute) to keep cache fresh.
   - **Streaming Updates**: Real-time updates via SSE or WebSockets when flags change.
   - **Fallback Behavior**: Use cached values if service is unreachable.

3. **CDN Caching**:
   - For static flag configurations that don't require user context.
   - Geographic distribution for lower latency.
   - Short TTL (30-60 seconds) to balance freshness and performance.

#### Evaluation Result Caching

1. **Request-Level Cache**:
   - Cache flag evaluation results within a single request.
   - Useful when the same flag is evaluated multiple times in one request.

2. **User-Level Cache**:
   - Optional caching of evaluation results by user ID.
   - Configurable TTL based on expected evaluation stability.
   - Invalidated when user attributes change or relevant flags update.

3. **Segment Cache**:
   - Cache segment membership results to avoid re-evaluating complex segment rules.
   - Invalidated when segment definitions change.

#### Cache Consistency

1. **Version Vectors**:
   - Each flag configuration has a version identifier.
   - SDKs track the version they have cached.
   - Only update cache when newer version is available.

2. **Change Propagation**:
   - Flag changes update database.
   - Database triggers or change data capture (CDC) publishes events.
   - Cache invalidation service processes events and updates Redis.
   - Redis publishes updates to connected SDKs.

3. **Stale Data Handling**:
   - Configurable grace period for stale cache data.
   - Circuit breaker for database fallback if cache service is unavailable.

### 5.2 Scaling Approach

The Feature Flag Service will be designed for horizontal scalability to handle large volumes of flag evaluations.

#### Service Scaling

1. **Stateless Services**:
   - All API services (Management, Evaluation) will be stateless.
   - Session data stored in Redis or database.
   - Enable horizontal scaling by adding more instances.

2. **Load Balancing**:
   - Round-robin for management API requests.
   - Consistent hashing for evaluation API to maximize cache locality.
   - Sticky sessions for streaming connections.

3. **Auto-Scaling**:
   - CPU utilization threshold (e.g., 70%).
   - Request rate thresholds.
   - Queue length for asynchronous processing.
   - Memory utilization for cache services.

#### Database Scaling

1. **Read Replicas**:
   - Direct read-heavy operations to replicas.
   - Primary-only writes for consistency.
   - Potential for read-your-writes consistency issues.

2. **Sharding**:
   - Potential future enhancement for very large installations.
   - Shard by organization or project for data locality.

3. **Supabase Scaling**:
   - Leverage Supabase's built-in scaling capabilities.
   - Monitor connection pools and query performance.

#### Cache Scaling

1. **Redis Scaling**:
   - Redis Cluster for sharding data across multiple nodes.
   - Redis Sentinel for high availability.
   - Redis Enterprise for managed scaling (production option).

2. **Local Cache Sizing**:
   - Memory limits for SDK local caches.
   - Eviction policies (LRU) to manage memory pressure.

#### Analytics Data Scaling

1. **Time-Series Partitioning**:
   - Partition evaluation events by time period.
   - Archive older data to cold storage.

2. **Aggregation Pipeline**:
   - Real-time aggregation for dashboards.
   - Pre-computed rollups for common queries.
   - Background processing for complex analytics.

### 5.3 Response Time Requirements

The Feature Flag Service must meet strict latency requirements to avoid impacting application performance.

#### Latency Targets

1. **Flag Evaluation API**:
   - P50 latency: < 10ms
   - P95 latency: < 30ms
   - P99 latency: < 50ms

2. **SDK Configuration Retrieval**:
   - P50 latency: < 50ms
   - P95 latency: < 100ms
   - P99 latency: < 200ms

3. **Management API**:
   - P50 latency: < 200ms
   - P95 latency: < 500ms
   - P99 latency: < 1000ms

4. **Streaming Updates**:
   - Update propagation time: < 500ms from change to client notification

#### Performance Monitoring

1. **Latency Tracking**:
   - Per-endpoint response time metrics.
   - Client-side SDK performance metrics.
   - Cache hit/miss ratio tracking.

2. **Alerting**:
   - Alerts on SLA violations.
   - Trend analysis for gradual degradation.
   - Error rate monitoring.

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Load testing for expected peak traffic.
   - Stress testing for failure conditions.
   - Chaos testing for resilience validation.

#### Optimization Techniques

1. **Request Batching**:
   - Batch multiple flag evaluations in a single request.
   - Evaluate all flags for a given user context at once.

2. **Connection Pooling**:
   - Database connection pools.
   - Redis connection pools.
   - HTTP keep-alive for client connections.

3. **Resource Prioritization**:
   - Prioritize evaluation API resources over management API.
   - QoS for different client types (server vs. mobile).
